We present PANTHEON: a game summarizing major historical figures biography into small, fun and tangible playing cards. The objective is twofold:
1. Keeping children away from screens by offering a fun card game.
2. Stimulating their curiosity by letting them read short biographies of important historical figures with a major impact (good or bad).
